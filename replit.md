- **System Status**: Real-time monitoring of all integrated services

## Data Flow

### 1. Real-time Data Pipeline
- Client queries dashboard data every 30 seconds via TanStack Query
- Server aggregates data from multiple sources (database + external APIs)
- Real-time status indicators show connection health and last sync time

### 2. AI Conversation Flow
- User input → Chat interface → Express API → OpenAI/Azure → Response processing → UI update
- Conversation history stored in database for context preservation
- File uploads processed through Multer and integrated into AI context

### 3. External API Integration
- Scheduled data sync from GHL, Stripe, and other services
- KPI aggregation and caching for dashboard performance
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms for service outages

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **React Ecosystem**: React 18, TanStack Query, Wouter routing
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui styling
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM, Neon PostgreSQL, connection pooling
- **AI Services**: OpenAI SDK, Azure Cognitive Services SDK
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe SDK for billing and subscriptions

### Integration SDKs
- **GoHighLevel**: Custom REST API integration
- **Google APIs**: Calendar API integration
- **Twilio**: SMS and voice services
- **Azure**: Speech services and cognitive search

### Development Tools
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety across frontend and backend
- **Vite**: Development server with HMR and optimized builds
- **ESBuild**: Production bundling for server-side code
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling with custom theme

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Local Development**: Vite dev server with Express backend
- **Hot Reloading**: Full stack hot reload support
- **Environment Variables**: Comprehensive .env configuration
- **Database**: Development database with Drizzle migrations

### Production Build Process
1. **Frontend Build**: Vite builds React app to `dist/public`
2. **Backend Build**: ESBuild bundles Express server to `dist/index.js`
3. **Database Migration**: Drizzle kit pushes schema changes
4. **Static Asset Serving**: Express serves built frontend assets

### Infrastructure Requirements
- **Database**: PostgreSQL-compatible database (Neon recommended)
- **External APIs**: Configured API keys for all integrations
- **Environment Variables**: Comprehensive configuration for all services
- **Storage**: File upload storage for AI document processing

### Security Considerations
- API keys secured server-side only (no client exposure)
- CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
- Input validation and sanitization for all endpoints
- Session management for user authentication (when implemented)

### Performance Optimizations
- TanStack Query caching and background refetching
- Lazy loading for non-critical components
- Optimized bundle splitting with Vite
- Efficient database queries with Drizzle ORM
