# How to Access Your SuperSal War Room HQ Deployment Files

## Method 1: Direct File Access in Replit

1. **In Replit, click the "Files" tab** (folder icon on the left)
2. **Navigate to the `tmp` folder**
3. **Look for:** `supersal-warroom-FINAL-DEPLOYMENT.tar.gz`
4. **Right-click the file** and select "Download"

## Method 2: Alternative Location

Your deployment files might also be in:
- `/tmp/supersal-deploy/` (the original deployment folder)
- Root directory of your Replit project

## Method 3: Copy to Root Directory

If you can't find the files in /tmp, I can copy them to your main project directory:

```bash
# Copy deployment to main directory
cp -r /tmp/supersal-deploy/* /home/runner/workspace/
```

## What You Need:

The deployment package contains:
- Complete SuperSal War Room HQ (410 files)
- All 8 pages and integrations
- Git repository ready to push
- Your GitHub token configured

## Quick Check:

If you can't find the files, let me know and I'll:
1. Move them to your main project directory
2. Create a new deployment package
3. Guide you through alternative download methods

Your SuperSal War Room HQ is ready - just need to get the files to you!
